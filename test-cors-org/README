The code behind http://test-cors.org

The code is divided into two parts:

1. The client code in src/client that makes the CORS request.
1. The server code in src/server that receives the CORS request.

The client and server code need to live on different origins (in order to be a
true cross-origin request). The code here is deployed to Google's App Engine.
